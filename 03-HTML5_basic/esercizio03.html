        My name is Giandomenico Porzio, and Iâ€™m an IT Student.
        I decided to study computer science because since when I was a child I was really curious about computers and
        all the stuffs corraletad.

        In my life I enjoy playing football, draw , listening to music and coding small projects just to have fun.
        I really love doing sports and this helps me a lot to control stress and anxiety.
